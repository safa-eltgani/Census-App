<h1>Welcome to the first stage of my life</h1>

<ol type="A" style= "color:#d9ad7c">
  <li>Born in Austin,Texas:

    </li>
  <li>Went to Brighton Horizon Elementary School (2004-2008):
   <ol type="a">
      <li>Was there from kindergarten to second grade.</li>
      <li>I remember two of my friends and a teacher, but the rest is a blurr. </li>

   <li>Moved to Cairo Egypt(2009):
 </ol>
   <h2>Interpretation:</h2>

<p>I was too young to remember how living in Austin impacted me as an indivudal at the time. However, now I can say that living in America and speaking primaily english is what made migrating to Egypt a hassle, a struggle to fit in as an American kid in the Middle East. It also pushed me away from my traditional roots as a daughter of a Sudanese immigrant because I grew up in the shadow of American kids,although my parents still lived the life of Sudanese. I think that was because although our parents assumed grouping us Sudanese kids together would help us bond culturally it did not becayse we were all as uncultured as one another.
